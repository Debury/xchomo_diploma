```

## Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Files are output to ./dist/
# FastAPI serves these at /app route
```

## Docker Deployment

The frontend is built as part of the Docker image:

```dockerfile
# In web-api Dockerfile, add:
WORKDIR /app/web_api/frontend
RUN npm install && npm run build
```

```

## Routes

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/app` | Dashboard |

## API Proxy (Development)

During development, Vite proxies these paths to the FastAPI backend:

- `/rag/*` → RAG endpoints
- `/embeddings/*` → Embedding stats
- `/sources/*` → Source management
- `/catalog/*` → Catalog batch processing
- `/schedules/*` → Dagster schedules
- `/settings/*` → System + credential settings
- `/auth/*` → Authentication
- `/health` → Health check
